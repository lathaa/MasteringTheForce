Instructions:
1.	Please read the console application guideline before you proceed to answer questions. Those guidelines will be used to answer all the console application questions. 
2.	You may use any SQL (Structured Query Language) to answer all query database questions.
3.	While for logic question, you may used pseudo code or any programming language you are familiar with.


Guidelines for console application question:
1.	Write(var);   [write a string/number in console window]
2.	Writeln(var); [write a string/number followed by new line in console application]
3.	Readln(var)   [insert user input to the given variable]
a.	Readln(n);    [user can enter any value to variable n]
4.	Loop syntax example:

	01:	For (i=1;i<=5;i++)	
	02:	Begin
	03:	     Write("abc");
	04:	      Writeln("");
	05:	 End;
        ------------------------------------------          
	01:	 I=1;
	02:	 While (i<6) do
	03:	 Begin
	04:	      Write("abc");
	05:	      Writeln("");
	06:	      i=i+1;
	07:	 End
        ---------------------------------------
	01:	 I=1;
	02:	 Repeat
	03:	     Write("abc");
	04:	     Writeln("");
	05:	     i=i+1;
	06:	  Until (i<=5);
                
        All the sample will ouput:
            abc
            abc
            abc
            abc
            abc

==============================================[Console Application Questions]==========================================
1.	What is the output of the simple console application? 

	01:	Begin
	02:	    a=1;
	03:	   b=1;
	04:	   c=a+b;
	05:	   write(c);
	06:	   a=b;
	07:	   b=c;
	08:	   c=a+b;
	09:	   write(c);
	10:	End;

2.	Using the given example of the loop syntax, how do you write a console application code to have below output?

	Case 1:
	Input = 5  <ask input from user>
   	Output= 12345 <output from code>

	Case 2:
	Input = 6  <ask input from user>
   	Output= 123456 <output from code>

	Case 3:
	Input = 3  <ask input from user>
   	Output= 123 <output from code>
	
2A.
	Readln(counter);
	01:	For (i=1;i<=counter;i++)	
	02:	Begin
	03:	     Write(i);
	04:	End;       	
	
==============================================[Logic Questions]==========================================
3.	How do you want to get the result of multiplication by 15 without using * (multiply operation) and + (plus operations).
3A.
// JavaScript
var input = prompt("give me a value");

var mul15 = function(x){
var solution = 0;
for(var i = 0; i < x; i ++){
solution += 15; 
}
return solution;
};

console.log(mul15(input));

//Since * and + operators are disallowed, I used the add/assign operator +=


4.	Suppose server S want to download real time video from one of existing media servers A, B, C, D. However the server S still doesn't know which media server is available and can provide the highest speed transfer. 

Please write a simple code to make the server S chooses the fastest server using below function:
a.	int get_speed(ServerID);
This function is used to get the transfer speed from Server[ServerID] to server S on HTTP protocol. The return value of this function is integer value. For example: get_speed(A) return 15, it means the transfer speed is 15 Kbps.

b.	bool  connect(server);
This function is to check the availability of the media server using RMTP (Real Time Message Protocol). This function will return true if the media server have the video source that can be streamed by server S. For example: connect(A) return true, it means server S can stream video from server A.

Hint: 
get_speed(serverID) function only check the transfer speed of the media server using normal HTTP. It doesn't guarantee the media server is available. Example: Media Server A may provide the highest transfer speed, however there is no video source available in media server A. So in this case, server B may connect to other server. 

4A.
var speedOfServer = function(server){	//Gets the speed of the server
	if(connect(server)){
	return get_speed(server);
	}
	return "Server " + server + " is not available.";
};

var highestSpeed = function(arr){		//returns the position in the passed array where the highest element is found
var fastest = 0;
var position;
for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i ++){
if(arr[i] > fastest){
fastest = arr[i];
position = i;
}
}
return position;
};

var main = function(){					//passed an array of Servers and their speed to highestSpeed() and returns the faster server
var workingServers = ["A","B","C","D"];
workingServers.push(speedOfServer(A));
workingServers.push(speedOfServer(B));
workingServers.push(speedOfServer(C));
workingServers.push(speedOfServer(D));
var finalPosition = highestSpeed(workingServers);
return "Server " + workingServers[finalPosition-4] + " is working at the speed of " + workingServers[finalPosition] + " kbps";
};

console.log(main());


==============================================[SQL Questions]==============================================
5.	Below is the customer table in database ABC.   

[Customer Table]:
	ID	Name	Salary	City
	====================================
	1	Romeo	1000	Surabaya
	2	Julia	3000	Ho chi min
	3	Robert	2000	Hongkong
	â€¦.			
	100	Deniro	5000	Singapore

	(total record = 100)
	(Id is Primary Key)	

	a.	Please provide a SQL script to query customer that salary is between 2000-3500!
	b.	Please provide a SQL script to query customer that his/her city occurs in the table more than or equal to 6.  
		Example:
     		  The number of customer that live in hongkong is 10
   		  The number of customer that live in surabaya=5 
   		  The number of customer that live in singapore=6. 
      		  So in this example the output should be all customer that live in Singapore and Hongkong only. 

5.a 
    SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE Salary between 2000 AND 3500
    
5.b 
    SELECT c*. FROM Customer c JOIN 
    (SELECT City,Count(*) as Count FROM Customer GROUP BY City) c1
     HAVING Count(*) >=6
     ON c.City = c1.City
